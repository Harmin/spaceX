Assignment to display spaceX data

In this assignment i have used a clean architecture to separate and make each layer independent of each other by using Dagger to keep everything decoupled from each other.

The framework used is MVVM to load the list of Launches on the UI, do sorting and filtering of the data, have made it quite dynamic rather than to only do one field filtering can do filtering based on various other fields

In terms of assumptions have only tried to explain and implement all the key features in the requirement and not displaying whole lot of data as no UI was required but have used all the latest principles and architectural components.

In the End, the goal of the assignment and how it is implemented is to go through MVVVM, Retrofit, Dagger, LiveData updations of UI and how to separate everything and use the kotlin extensions to do few operations.
